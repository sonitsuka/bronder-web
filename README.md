# Bronder Artist Website  https://sarahbronder.com/
Illustrator's simple Portfolio Website 


## Version 1:
Design by Figma, created page by React Gatsdby & Sass 

## Version 2:
Same prototype, that is implemented by only pure CSS (Flexbox & Grid, no Bootstrap and similar extended CSS), HTML with iconify, and image lightbox with JavaScript.

## Version 3:
Version 3 will be made from a more dynamic structure, images in the Database. I'll creat own API for the works images, id, title, descriptions in JSON file. Javascript file calls these data.
